javascript-object-initialization
================================

a very simple example of javascript object initialization

In many cases an object can have more than one propertu, objectÂ 
initialization can be the way to go. Here is the example:

computer = {drive:"floppy", cpu:"intel", ram:"ddr"}

basicly it says in computer object has 3 properties drive, cpu 
and ram.

to get each property within the computer object, we just simply write

computer.drive //floppy
computer.cpu //intel
computer.ram //ddr

try it by writing
document.write("I want a" + computer.drive + " and " + computer.cpu + 
" and " + computer.ram);
